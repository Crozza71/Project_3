#FLASH!

Ever wanted to go to an event at the last minute and wanted a ticket but didn't want to go to the stadium without knowing you had one?
Look no further.......

Login
Find your ticket
Fetch your ticket
Enjoy!

Let us introduce the 
##FLASH APP!!

###How does this work?

Enter our site and see the tickets you want for an event.....everyone loves the most expensive CORRS ticket , don't they?

Thankfully we know of a seller that can't make it. 

He has a login and is about to add a ticket.


###What do YOU need to do?

Register and login.

Now a list of all the tickets pop up. 
Lets find the Corrs ticket.

Click on get ticket......BINGO!!! 
You are half way there!!

As you can see, the ticket has now been put on hold for you, for the seller to authorise.

Can you see where he is located?

### What can the seller see?

Ok, so the seller logs in ......

If you look at his ticket, it has ticket ready to be authorised or rejected. If we click authorise, the ticket is sold.

We also have the option to reject from buying a ticket

The ticket is now out of the sellers list.

Check the buyers list!!

There it is.

Enjoy the Corrs!

### How did this come about?

Wire frames....

The general idea was there, but these have changed many a time with the theme being similar.

###What were the enjoyable bits and where was the struggle?
 
 
1.Working as a group was both good and challenging. A problem halved is a problem solved, but github had its own challenges.  
 2.Google maps left some interesting challenges and conversations, but was achieved.  
 3. Authentication became more interesting when realising we didnt need two authorisations but only one, having built both.  
4. Linking buyer and seller via a token proved challenging

### What would we add in FLASH 2.0 ?

1. Buyer location and moving time frames
Chat function between buyer and seller
2. Payment method directly online.
3. Bidding auction on tickets 
4. Profile pictures
5. Imagery on tickets scanned into the app
